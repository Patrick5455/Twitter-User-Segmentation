# Twitter User Segmentation for Nike Marketing Campaign

> Analysing Africa Twitter Influentials

### Objective

This analysis is aimed at identifying top twitter influencer and most influential
government official accounts on Twitter.
Top Influncers would be identified based on three different metrics:
- 1. Reach (Followers count)
- 2. Popularity (Likes & Retweets)
- 3. Relevance (Mentions counts & Reply counts)

The findings from this analysis would be used to recommend a certain line of
actions to Nike Inc in its proposed expansion to Africa. The data would be
gathered using the Twitter API.
